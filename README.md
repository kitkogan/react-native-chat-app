# react-native-chat-app

I created this simple chat application using React Native and Socket.io. 

Live demo not available at this time.

Requires Expo to spin up.

npm install
cd MobileApp
'expo start' on client side, choose how you would like to view from metro bundler
cd socket.io-backend
'npm start' to start server on backend
